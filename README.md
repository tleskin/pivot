#The Pivot

#Lend-io: Micro-lending platform

== README

The Pivot is the first project for Module 3 at Turing School. Learning goals include:
  * Adapt the existing restaurant models to belong to individual businesses
  * Mind security permissions such that each business does not have any knowledge of other businesses’ data
  * Push all logic down to the model layer so controllers and views remain simple
  * Use and switch between multiple view templates to reduce view-layer logic
  * Implement a clean, logical order flow that minimizes customer frustration
  * Practice working with a "legacy" codebase to add substantial functionality
  * Use outside-in TDD/BDD to drive all layers of Rails development
  * Use a professional project management tool to pace and track progress

The full requirements can be seen at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/the_pivot.html

The team was expected to take an existing Dinner Dash project that was created as
a final project in Module 2 and "pivot" it into a completely different project.
